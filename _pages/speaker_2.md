**[Jason Fries](https://web.stanford.edu/~jfries/)** is a research scientist in the Shah Lab at Stanford University. Previously I was a CS postdoc in Stanford's Mobilize Center, mentored by Chris RÃ© and Scott Delp. He is interested in tools and methods that enable domain experts to rapidly build and modify machine learning models. He is most passionate about medical application of machine learning, where obtaining large-scale, expert-labeled training data is a significant challenge. His research focuses on weakly supervised machine learning, training foundation models for medicine, and methods for data-centric AI.
