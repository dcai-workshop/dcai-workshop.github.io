### ABSTRACT

The emergence of Data-centric AI (DCAI) represents a pivotal shift in AI development, redirecting focus from model refinement to prioritizing data quality. This paradigmatic transition emphasizes the critical role of data in AI. While past approaches centered on refining models, they often overlooked potential data imperfections, raising questions about the true potential of enhanced model performance. DCAI advocates the systematic engineering of data, complementing existing efforts and playing a vital role in driving AI success. This transition has spurred innovation in various machine learning and data mining algorithms and their applications on the Web. Therefore, we propose the DCAI Workshop at WWW’24, which offers a platform for academic researchers and industry practitioners to showcase the latest advancements in DCAI research and their practical applications in the real world.

### OBJECTIVES

Data-centric AI (DCAI) is a burgeoning concept that shifts our attention from advancing model design towards the pursuit of data excellence, which marks a significant surge in recognizing the crucial importance of data in the realm of AI. In the past, AI was predominantly viewed through a model-centric lens, with a primary focus on refining model designs to boost AI performance using fixed datasets. However, this approach tends to neglect potential data imperfections, such as missing values, incorrect labels, and anomalies. This raises the critical question of whether the numerous enhancements in model performance authentically reflect the model’s true potential, or if they are merely a consequence of overfitting to the dataset. DCAI represents an emerging frontier that complements existing efforts, underscoring the systematic engineering of data in AI development1 , and plays an increasingly important role in propelling AI to success.

The transition to DCAI has ignited a wave of innovation in machine learning and data mining algorithms. These encompass a spectrum of cutting-edge techniques such as graph learning, trustworthy machine learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) . These advancements have found applications not only in computer science but have also permeated diverse domains including finance, information systems, mechanical engineering, robotic, and beyond. In this workshop, our objective is to delve into the recent advances in both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of DCAI.

#### Selection Process 

Each of the eight invited keynote speakers from both academia and industry (four each) are planned to be well recognized in the WWW community, especially in the subcommunity focused on data-centric AI. Some of the invited keynote speakers we have already agreed upon and they have accepted conditional on the acceptance of our proposed data-centric AI (DCAI) workshop at WWW’24. The remaining keynote speakers will be selected by the DCAI organization committee and will ensure a balanced distribution of those coming from industry and academia. Additionally, we note that each keynote will be presented as a lecture with slides and there will be a short Q/A session at the end of each keynote.

This workshop CFP is for paper submissions that will undergo the standard double-blind peer-review process. We will invite a well experienced set of program committee members for DCAI to first guarantee each paper submission will be reviewed by at least two PC members and second to ensure an informed and fair evaluation of the work being submitted. Based upon the reviews provided by PC members, the final recommendation of acceptance or rejection to DCAI at WWW’24 will be made by the workshop organizers.

The detailed review comments and notification letter will be sent to the authors accordingly along with detailed information as to whether they have been accepted for an oral or poster presentation (as noted above in the tentative workshop schedule).

#### Online Materials

A website for this workshop will be made available online if our workshop is accepted into WWW’24, which will include all the relevant information and materials including CFP, schedule, organization and PC member lists, keynote speaker and talk information, presentation slides and posters, accepted papers, etc. We will extend the website from DCAI at WWW’24 to include the details for our proposed second iteration to be held at WWW’24.
